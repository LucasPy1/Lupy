# Project Lupy
Welcome to Lupy! A innovative solution made to monitor your self development in a cool way!
With this project, i intend to solve a big issue of our lives: self development.

Lupy has come up with the idea that it is possible to learn while having fun. Its design employs the concept of gamification to actively engage users in skill development, while enabling the measurement of their progress over time.

The application is developed using the Python language and the Django framework.

I hope you like it!Suggestions are always welcome!
